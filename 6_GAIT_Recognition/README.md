### Gait Recognition
Each individual has unique style of walking. Thus we can identify a person by analyzing the gait.
### About this module
We use OpenPose to get skeletal data from input video frame.
Then we extract temporal features out of POSE descriptors generated by Pose detection module, we use  GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) with average temporal pooling. The output of GRU is 1D identification vector. 
SVM is then trained to classify the identification vectors accordingly.

Pose is estimated based on 16 body joints.





### How to use
