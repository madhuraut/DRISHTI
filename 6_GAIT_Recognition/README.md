### Gait Recognition

### About this module

Human gaits are the various ways in which a human can move, either naturally or as a result of specialized training. 
To extract temporal features out of POSE descriptors generated by Pose detection module, we use  GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) with average temporal pooling. The output of GRU is 1D identification vector. 
SVM is then trained to classify the identification vectors accordingly in real time

Pose is estimated based on 16 body joints.
Pose estimation Model: “MPII+LSP”
Gait Recognition Model: “Human3.6m”
Using Residual Convolution Network. 




### How to use
